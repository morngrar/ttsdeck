## Tabletop Simulator Deck creator for cards from FFG

This script has been modified from the original, [ttsdeck](https://github.com/rchiossi/ttsdeck) to take a directory of images, including one `back.jpg` and generate a deck file `deck.jpg` in that same directory with all the cards in it. Note that the user must ensure that the folder contains no more than 69 cards including the back.
